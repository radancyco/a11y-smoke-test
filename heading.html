title: Heading-Level Outline
---

<h1 id="primary-heading">{{ page.title }}</h1>

<p>A web page should strive to have a single <code>h1</code> element only and to avoid skipping headings. A logical heading structure is very important for <em>everybody</em> so that the page can be more easily understood and navigated. The search engines appear to like this, too.</p>

<div id="inner-content">

  <p class="loading">Loading...</p>

</div>
